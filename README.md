Right now Glowcase adds three blocks: the Text Block, the Hyperlink Block, and the Item Display Block. The Text Block acts as a more flexible sign, while the Hyperlink Block displays a URL that players can click on to open, and the Item Display Block is a more freeing item frame that also allows you to show off entities with their appropriate spawn egg.
